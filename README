Yet Another Package Manager

May still undergo a name change. I'm open to suggestions.

The goal of yapm is to have a package manager that is able
to portably install software from various sources on the
internet with minimal effort by the user. It was inspired
by the xkcd universal install script.

Let's define portable: I want it to be able to work on
a variety of Unix Systems: Mac, Linux, *BSD without the
need of manually installing any software.

For now the user can handle installing libraries for
any software that they may need.

Supported Sources:
github.com
gnu

Future Goals:
gitlab

Flags

-s
    will set the source to find the code from

-n
    dry run. Don't try making or installing.

-f
    fuck it. Try to install by running all
    executable files in the root of the project
    directory.

Ex.
    yapm -s gnu search libc
    yapm search couch
