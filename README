Yet Another Package Manager

May still undergo a name change. I'm open to suggestions.

The goal of yapm is to have a package manager that is able
to portably install software from various sources on the
internet with minimal effort by the user. It was inspired
by the xkcd universal install script.

Let's define portable: I want it to be able to work on
a variety of Unix Systems: Mac, Linux, *BSD without the
need of manually installing any software.

For now the user can handle installing libraries for
any software that they may need.

Supported Sources:
github

Future Goals:
gitlab
gnu ftp sites

Ideas for flags

-s, --source
    will set the source to find the code from

Ex.
    yapm -s github libc


We should read a configuration file to see
which source we should search by default.

No config just use github.

We should also start building all of the software in a chroot.
Is this supported on all Unixes? Other problems with this is
it would require that yapm be run with root privledges. The
user may not have those privileges. This could be an option

-r
    Build the program in it's own chroot. (requires superuser privledges)
